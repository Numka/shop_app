The project was done as a part of this course - https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/

# Configuration

If you want to build a working application from this code you would need a firebase API key. Create a .env file and insert it together with FIREBASE_API_KEY= as a plain text.

Or you could message me and I will provide you an APK.
